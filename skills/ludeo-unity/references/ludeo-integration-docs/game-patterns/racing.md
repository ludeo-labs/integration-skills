# Racing Genre Patterns (Unity)

> **Applies to:** Arcade Racers, Sim Racing, Kart Racers, Time-Trial, Combat Racing
> **Load when:** Game involves vehicles, lap-based or point-to-point tracks, position/ranking against
> opponents, lap/race timing
>
> Action names below map to `[SDK]` `LudeoGameplaySession.SendAction(string)` via the `[Layer]`
> `LudeoController.SendAction` (see `phase 7`).

## 1. Actions Catalog

> **Candidates, not a capture list.** The **Tier** column ranks capture priority for *this* genre;
> still apply phase 6's keep test before sending any action.
> - **T1 — Capture:** signature scored milestones / one-shot highlights that define the genre.
> - **T2 — Capture if scored or a notable beat in *this* game;** otherwise drop.
> - **T3 — Usually drop:** tracked **state** or high-frequency noise — capturing bloats the Ludeo.
>   Keep only if exceptionally scored. (Rows with both Objective and Scoring empty are almost always T3.)
>
> **Genre T3 traps:** `Drift`/`Slipstream`/`OffTrack`/`WrongWay`/`Spinout`/`TopSpeed` are **continuous
> states** — track speed / on-track / drift-angle as attributes and send an action only where it's a
> *scored* mechanic (e.g. `Drift` in a drift-scoring kart racer). `CheckpointPass` is high-frequency —
> keep only if checkpoints are scored; otherwise rely on lap/progress tracking.
>
> **Scope (phase 6) — orthogonal to tier:** player-scoped — `LapComplete`, `RaceFinish`, `Overtake`,
> `BestLap`, `Position1st`, `Collision` (the player's car); **global** (no guard, fire once) —
> `RaceStart` and other race-wide lifecycle events.

## 2. Search Keywords

Grep these in C# method/field names and comments. In Unity, lap/checkpoint detection usually routes
through trigger volumes (`OnTriggerEnter` on checkpoint colliders), collisions through
`OnCollisionEnter`, and vehicle dynamics through `Rigidbody`/`WheelCollider` — search those too.

### Race Flow / Timing
```
race, grandprix, gp, event, session, heat, qualify, qualifying
lap, laps, lapCount, lapTime, sector, split, checkpoint, waypoint, OnTriggerEnter
start, startLine, finish, finishLine, gridPosition, grid, countdown

## 3. Tracking Checklist

After object tracking is implemented (phase 9), verify these are covered. Types map to `[SDK]`
`SetAttribute` overloads (see `12-SDK-API-REFERENCE.md`). Sections are tiered by restoration priority:
- **CRITICAL** — restore or the replayed moment is visibly wrong.
- **IMPORTANT** — restore for fidelity; recognizable without it but degraded.
- **OPTIONAL** — situational/cosmetic; capture only if it affects the specific captured moment.

### Player Vehicle — CRITICAL
- [ ] Position (`Vector3`)
- [ ] Rotation (`Quaternion`)
- [ ] Velocity / speed (`Vector3` or scalar)
- [ ] Current lap number
- [ ] Current race position / rank
- [ ] Lap / sector times (current + best)
- [ ] Track progress (lap distance / spline position)
- [ ] Boost / nitro charge
- [ ] Vehicle damage / condition
- [ ] Fuel / tire state (sim racers)

### Race State — CRITICAL
- [ ] Race phase (countdown, racing, finished)
- [ ] Total laps
- [ ] Elapsed race time
- [ ] Full standings / running order
- [ ] Active penalties (per racer)

### Opponents / AI Racers — IMPORTANT
- [ ] Position, rotation
- [ ] Velocity / speed
- [ ] Current lap number
- [ ] Race position / rank
- [ ] Track progress
- [ ] Racer / driver ID
- [ ] AI difficulty / behavior state
- [ ] Held item (kart racers)

### Items / Pickups (kart racers) — OPTIONAL
- [ ] Position
- [ ] Item type
- [ ] Is collected / available
- [ ] Respawn state (if applicable)
- [ ] Active projectiles (type, owner, position, velocity)

### Track / Environment — OPTIONAL
- [ ] Track / circuit ID
- [ ] Checkpoint states (per racer)
- [ ] Weather / track surface conditions (if affects gameplay)
- [ ] Time of day / lighting
- [ ] Level metadata (track name, race mode, lap count, opponent count)
